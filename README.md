# UselessTopSongs
A collection of some random favourite miscellaneous songs of mine and my friends.

Trying out some more CSS + HTML. <br>
Had problems in making website responsive for mobile due to the design. Might revisit / remake the entire thing later on. <br>
Used a LOT of js. In the html file only.
<br>
<br>
2 Issues : <br>
`caught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML')` Whenever trying to import the JS code from the <script> tag in HTML to an external .js file an error is thrown. <br>
Site looks DOGSHIT on mobile. Designed with only web in mind.

<br>
To do : <br>
1) Maybe add some form of background animation for each of the songs? <br>
2) Import the `information` page from `The.Archive`.
